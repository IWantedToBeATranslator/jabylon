# Installation

No matter if you choose to install Jabylon as a standalone application or deploy a WAR in your favorite application server, there is only minimal configuration effort involved.
Please note that you will need to log in to adjust configuration in Jabylon. The default user is `Administrator` with the password `changeme`. 
It is important to change this default password after your first login to secure Jabylon.

The following pages will cover the different installation methods:
